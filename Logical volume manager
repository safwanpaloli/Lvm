      Logical volume manager (LVM)


why user lvm?

The main advantages of LVM are increased abstraction, flexibility, and control. Logical volumes can have meaningful names like “databases” or “root-backup”.
Volumes can be resized dynamically as space requirements change and migrated between physical devices within the pool on a running system or exported easily.
